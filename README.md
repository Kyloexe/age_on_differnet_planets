# age_on_differnet_planets
This program uses Kepler's Third Law to calculate the user's age of different planets.
Kepler's Third Law uses elliptical geometry to solve for the orbital period, orbital velocity and other orbital information. 
This program only calculates the orbital period of the planet, and prints the equililent age in Earth years.
